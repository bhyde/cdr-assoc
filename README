Cdr-assoc is a ASDF Common Lisp library which provides a package, CDR-ASSOC,
which exports an accessor function CDR-ASSOC, e.g. (cdr (assoc key alist ...))
and along with a setf method for that accessor.

For example.

  * (defvar *inventory* '((:apples . 3) (:pears . 7)))
  *inventory
  * (cdr-assoc :apples *inventory*)
  3
  * (incf (cdr-assoc :apples *inventory*))
  4
  * (cdr-assoc :apples *inventory*)
  4
  * (cdr-assoc :grapes *inventory*)
  nil
  * (setf (cdr-assoc :grapes *inventory*) 31)
  7
  * *inventory*
  ((:grapes . 31) (:apples . 4) (:pears . 7))
  *

This is all very analagous to what you can do with getf; but
sadly we don't have an optional default value to return if
the assoc comes back nil
